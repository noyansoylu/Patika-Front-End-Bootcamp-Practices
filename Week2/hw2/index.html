            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>George Orwell, born Eric Arthur Blair on June 25, 1903, in Motihari, India, was a British writer, journalist, and social critic. Known for his sharp intellect and keen observations, Orwell grew up in England after his family returned there when he was a young boy. Educated at Eton College, Orwell later worked as a colonial police officer in Burma before resigning to pursue writing. His early experiences deeply influenced his disdain for imperialism, a theme reflected in much of his work.<br>
            Orwell’s literary achievements include some of the most influential works of the 20th century. His novels Animal Farm (1945) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) are powerful allegories that critique authoritarianism and totalitarianism. Animal Farm satirizes the rise of Soviet communism, while Nineteen Eighty-Four explores themes of surveillance, propaganda, and individual freedom in a dystopian future. These works solidified Orwell’s reputation as a champion of truth and liberty. <br>
            Orwell's life was marked by his commitment to social justice and equality. He fought in the Spanish Civil War against fascism and later documented his experiences in Homage to Catalonia (1938). His essays, such as "Shooting an Elephant" and "Politics and the English Language," showcase his ability to critique both political and societal norms with wit and clarity. <br>
            Despite his relatively short life—he passed away at 46 in 1950 due to tuberculosis—Orwell’s works continue to inspire and provoke thought. His legacy as a defender of truth and an advocate for human rights remains as relevant today as it was in his lifetime.</p>
